1. **Polyfills must behave as if they were built-in.** This means strictly following the ES standard and extrapolating from there, to preserve consistency as much as possible, including the smallest details.
2. **Keep it readable, simple, and educational.** Sometimes, these 3 are mutually exclusive, so I may include comments to add educational value, not just as clarification of what/why the code is doing. In the past, I sacrificed simplicity in exchange of unnecessary potential performance, but I realized the engine will (usually) know how to perfectly optimize something, and minificaton is very important because some minifiers may not recognize complex code. So keeping it simple has a net gain for everyone and everything, even though it can sacrifice educational value.
