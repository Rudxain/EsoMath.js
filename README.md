# Introduction
As some of you may know, Javascript is based on the ECMAscript standard, which is a language specification that defines how JS source code must be interpreted and how it behaves at runtime. This spec is always evolving, a lot of new functions, objects, methods, syntax, etc. is added or modified, a small amount of things are deprecated and removed. However, even though JS and ES are very well supported by the community, every change must be reviewed using a strict multi-stage process known as "tc39 Process" (that's what I understood, I may be wrong), which slows down the progress to make sure only wanted/necessary things are actually changed officially. There are many proposals, some of these **VERY** useful, others are still useful but in very specific scenarios.

# Purpose
My purpose/goal with this library is to make it easy for developers to use future ES functions today, without writting everything from scratch (reusing code is good practice as long as the license is respected). I also want to include more *obscure* functions to serve as an educational tool for programmers and math students.

# Usage
I normally select all text in a file, and copy-paste it into the browser console or a `<script>` tag in a HTML file. This is something that doesn't require installation, because it's not an app by itself, just internal "tools" that an app may use.

# DISCLAIMER
Currently some part of source code in this repo is unfinished, badly optimized, in need of refactoring, or all at the same time (sorry lol). Most of the code is in good state though, so don't worry. If you're unsure and want to avoid problems, just read the code comments, most bugs and unfinished stuff are described there.
